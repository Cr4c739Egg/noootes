cron should be empty

syslog deamon creates the logs

rsyslog.conf shows the rules

touching ssh at all makes a log

does the proc log exist and the timestamp is current? if yes, then its active then u need to make abnormal logging report

lastcomm - proclog

sec products
some commands can be afected, to get around, call the binary itself. /bin/ls
cloud based cant read logs
timestamps for reports are the file timestamps not the actual logs
